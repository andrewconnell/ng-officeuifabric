Native `<button>` and `<a>` elements are always used in order to provide the most straightforward
and accessible experience for users. A `<button>` element should be used whenever some _action_
is performed. An `<a>` element should be used whenever the user will _navigate_ to another view.

There are four button variants, each applied using the `uif-type` attribute

| Attribute          | Description                                                                 |
